## Q2. Review Existing Unstructured Data and Diagram a New Structured Relational Data Model <br/>

To make the Unstructured Data I created an ER diagram. <br/>
For making Structured ER diagram I looked if any data are connected with each other. User data and receipts data is connected with each other as receipts have User primary key as foreign key.  They have one to many relations. As one user can have many receipts. Brand Data is not connected with any of the Data. Such kind of ER diagram in which all the data are not connected with each other is called  <br/><br/>
The following diagram shows the ER diagram for all Data.<br/>
